      It is random, but sometimes VS just won’t load the .props files
      for nugets. So we have to force a project reload using the trick
      of touching the project file and make an error to mask the error
      that CefSharp.Common.targets would otherwise emit. See
      https://github.com/binki/DirectConneX.CefSharp.SuppressAnyCpuBuildError/issues/1

      Regarding BeforeTargets: PlatformCheck is the name of the target
      in CefSharp.Common.targets that explodes (at least in
      73.1.130). We also include BeforeResolveAssemblyReferences which
      should run before PlatformCheck just in case the target name
      changes.

      Name="DirectConneX_CefSharp_SuppressAnyCpuBuildError_ForceReloadIfPropsNotLoaded">
    <!--
        Trigger VS to request the user to reload the project. That
        generally fixes this issue.

        Show our own error to mask the error that
        CefSharp.Common.targets would show. Hopefully the user sees
        our error instead of CefSharp.Common.targets’s so that the
        user doesn’t try to modify their project file unnecessarily.
